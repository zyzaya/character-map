  title: "Strength (STR) Ability Score"
  info: |
    Page 175 of the Player's Handbook outlines that your Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.

    Your ability score comes from a combination of character creation, your race, Ability Score Improvements, and Feats.

    Character creation is described on pages 12-13 of the Player's Handbook.

    Races are described on pages 17-43 of the Player's Handbook. On page 12 there is a summary table of what races increase what abililty scores on page 12.
    The races mountain dwarf, half-Orc, dragonborn, and human allow for increases in strength.

    Ability Score Improvements are described in the sections outlining classes
    on pages 45-119 of the Player's Handbook. They allow you to increase one
    ability score by 2, or two ability scores by 1.

    As described on page 165 of the Player's Handbook, a Feat can replace
    an Ability Score Improvement, some of which increase Ability Scores. 

    The table in the first section of each class description indicates when 
    Ability Score Improvements are gained. This is levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19. 
    The Fighter class gets additional Ability Score Improvements at levels 6
    and 14, as indicated in the table on page 71 of the Player's Handbook.
